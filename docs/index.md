[Home](https://github.cmdshell.uk/)

A repository for all those thoughts, random ideas, bits, bobs, and pieces of code that don't really have a home. Think bitbucket, for code.

This page is powered by Jekyll and the GitHub repository, it allows me to add easily build multiple test environments to assist in web development as you'll see below. There's much more to this repo than just web development though. Take a look through and you'll see its where I dump all sorts of odds and sods as I learn various languages and develop computer science skills. Think of it as a collection of gists, perhaps you'll find something hidden away here that sparks a new idea into life.
