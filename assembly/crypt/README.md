A project folder for investigation into designing programs that perform ciphers, encoding, decoding, encryption, and decryption.

**PLEASE NOTE:** _these programs are purely built for educational and recreational purposes, anyone choosing to use them for encrypting sensitive or illegal information, or any nefarious purpose such as breaking passwords or decrypting other peoples sensitive data, takes upon themselves the full responsibilities of their actions. It should also be noted the methods I'm using here are not complex, and if I can figure it out, anyone can with minimal expertise. These methods should not be used to secure anything of value as they are generally considered insecure, and you should instead trust in the air-tight mathematics of professional encryption algorithms for data you wish to remain secret._
