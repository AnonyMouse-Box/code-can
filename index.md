[Home](https://github.enim.ga/)

A repository for all those thoughts, random ideas, bits, bobs, and pieces of code that don't really have a home. Think bitbucket, for code.

This page is powered by Jekyll and the GitHub repository, it allows me to add useful links and multiple test pages to assist in web development.
